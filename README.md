## About this project

For this personal portfolio project, I took on the role of a BI Developer for a customer service department at a major bank. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard to help managers track and improve their team's performance in handling customer tickets and complaints.

## The Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Tickets_Data.xlsx file. It contains ticket records from the bank's customer service system, covering various categories of issues like failed transactions, POS issues, and ATM problems. It includes data on ticket status, resolution times, and agent performance metrics.

## Key Assumptions

When designing this dashboard, I made some assumptions about what the customer service managers would need:

1. Managers want to quickly assess their team's current performance against key metrics.
2. They need to identify areas where the team is excelling or struggling.
3. Managers want to spot trends in ticket volumes and types to allocate resources effectively.
4. They need to evaluate individual agent performance to provide targeted support.
5. The ability to compare their team's performance to overall department averages is valuable.

## The Dashboard

I created a two-page dashboard focused on usability and providing actionable insights. Here's a breakdown of what I included:

### Page 1: Tickets Overview

This page gives managers a high-level view of ticket performance:

- Key metric cards show opened tickets, closed tickets, complaint resolution rate, and SLA count.
- A bar chart breaks down the most common ticket categories, helping managers identify recurring issues.
- A line chart displays opened and closed tickets over time, allowing managers to spot trends and seasonality.

The filters at the top let managers slice the data by year, month, category, priority level, and work type for more detailed analysis.

### Page 2: Resolution and Agent Performance

This page dives deeper into performance metrics:
- Cards showing the percentage of tickets meeting SLA and average resolution time give a quick performance snapshot.
- A donut chart breaks down tickets by work type (transaction issues vs. fraud/security issues).
- A column chart displays tickets by severity, helping managers prioritize critical issues.
- A detailed agent performance table lets managers assess individual team members on metrics like closure rate and SLA adherence.

## Why I Built It This Way

1. **Clarity**: I used clear, contrasting colors and simple layouts to make the data easy to read at a glance.
2. **Interactivity**: The filters allow managers to drill down into specific time periods or ticket types for deeper analysis.
3. **Actionable insights**: By highlighting key metrics and breaking down performance by agent, the dashboard helps managers quickly identify areas for improvement.
4. **Comparison**: Showing overall averages alongside team-specific data helps managers gauge their performance against the department as a whole.
5. **Flexibility**: The two-page layout separates high-level overview from detailed performance metrics, catering to different analysis needs.

In a real-world scenario, I'd collaborate closely with the customer service managers to refine the dashboard based on their feedback and evolving needs. This project showcases my ability to turn raw data into a user-friendly, insightful tool for improving business operations.
